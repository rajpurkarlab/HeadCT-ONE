Mild to moderate enlargement of the lateral and third ventricles is stable. There are no signs of acute stroke or intracranial bleeding, but there is a new mass effect noted which was not previously identified. Displacement of midline structures and extra-axial fluid accumulation are absent. Vascular: No evidence of hyperdense vessels. Skull: There is no fracture or localized bony abnormality. Sinuses\/Orbits: The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. Bilateral cataract extraction is noted. Other: No additional findings."}
